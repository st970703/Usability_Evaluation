A total of 10 developers were asked to evaluate the usability of the system which has been implemented as a plugin to the IntelliJ IDE. After an initial training, users were tasked to find the intent of an obfuscated variable in code using both the gaze-based browsing feature and the IDE provided browsing features. The users then evaluated these two methods using a System Usability Score (SUS) measure. They were also asked to list what additional features they would like to see in the future.
The SUS score of the system obtained from the evaluation was at 77.75 which is a good score on the percentile rank.  The most requested feature was the ability to scroll in the editor using gaze.

Discussion
The developed plugin has a good usability score indicating that eye gaze data is a promising means of input to an IDE.
Scrolling with eyes being the most requested feature indicates that users prefer to perform all functionality with the eyes given a choice.
Future Work
Configuring the confirm buttons on the sides to support additional functionality.
Applying an appropriate filter on the gaze stream data to reduce noise in the data.
Adding support for scrolling in the text editor using gaze.

Conclusion
An IntelliJ plugin which enables users to browse source code using just their eyes has been developed. 
The plugin implements the “Find All Usages” and “Go To Declaration” features of the IDE.
The plugin has a good usability score as measured using the SUS scale.
The results show that most users preferred using the gaze-controlled browsing ability and agreed that it would help to enhance their productivity.
